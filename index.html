            <p>Delichon is a genus of birds in the swallow family containing four species named as house martins. These are chunky, bull-headed and short-tailed birds, blackish-blue above, with a white rump and white or grey underparts. They have feathering on their toes and tarsi. They breed in Europe, Asia and the mountains of North Africa. The common (example pictured), Siberian and Asian house martins all migrate south in winter, while the Nepal house martin is resident in the Himalayas. House martins nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings. Both parents build the lined mud nest, incubate the three or four white eggs of a typical clutch and feed the chicks. Aerial hunters of small insects, they may be caught by fast birds of prey and may carry fleas or other parasites. None of the species are considered threatened, although common house martin numbers have declined in parts of Europe due to poor weather, poisoning by pesticides and nest-site competition with house sparrows.

            <p>SMS Oldenburg was the fourth Helgoland-class battleship of the Imperial German Navy. Built between 1909 and 1912 at the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig, Oldenburg was assigned to I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for most of her career, including World War I. Oldenburg participated in all of the major fleet operations during the conflict against the British Grand Fleet, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916, the largest naval battle of the war. The ship also saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Imperial Russian Navy. After the German collapse in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet was interned and then scuttled in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships remained in Germany but were ceded to the Allied powers as war reparations; Oldenburg was given to Japan, which sold the vessel to a British ship-breaking firm in 1920. She was scrapped in Dordrecht in 1921. (This article is part of a featured topic: Battleships of Germany.)</p>

            <p>The Milgram experiment(s) on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, men in the age range of 20 to 50 from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a "learner". These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real.</p>
